LCD Pannel for 3d Printers such as the Reprap and others.

This is a 3D printable front panel for my Reprap printer.

It is loosely based upon the ultimaker front panel using a rotary encoder and 20x4 LCD display.

The file is parametric allowing several different iterations an all hole sizes are brought out to the top of the file for easy adjustment to your printer.

The SD module used is a cheap unit found easily on E-bay, other Sd card modules will no doubt work ok as well.
